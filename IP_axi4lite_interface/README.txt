AXI4-lite slave interface

This IP is an AXI4-lite slave interface with internal registers.

To use the IP in Qsys, create a new component and map as follows:
    - axi_clk_i to a Clock Input interface
    - axi_reset_i to a Reset Input interface
    - AXI4-Lite signals to an AXI4Lite Slave interface
    - User input-output signals to a Conduit interface
